printf()

A printf function built by Charity Mwangi and Susan Wafula for ALX.

We are using the printf() C library locared in stdio.h library but we are rebuilding it. Functions that our project is requred to print with  are %d, %c, %% and %s specifiers to standard output. Printf returns the number of characters printed.
